                          THE SPEY STANDARD WHITELIST
                          ===========================
                          
SMTP email is hard. The RFCs are complex and subtle. There are a lot of
people out there bending the rules in an attempt to make lives easier for
themselves --- spey, for one.

Unfortunately, there are some people who bend the rules sufficiently so that
when they encounter spey bending the rules in the other direction, the rules
get stressed beyond their capacity and break... leading to an inability to
send email.

This usually happens when they do something spectacularly stupid, which means
that strictly it should be entirely their problem, but occasionally in the
interests of expediency it's easier just to bypass the problem by whitelisting
them.

This file lists some of the major service providers that whitelisting is
required for. If you want to communicate with users at these providers, you'll
have to add the entries to your whitelist.

If you know of any more useful whitelist entries that should go in here,
please send them to me (dg@cowlark.com).



YAHOO GROUPS

When you subscribe to a Yahoo mailing list (why do they call them 'groups'?),
Yahoo's servers will try to probe your address to make sure it's valid. When
Spey responds with a 451 'Try Again Later' message, they assume that the
address is invalid and won't send any mail to it. This, obviously, is
violating the RFC. (The servers they use to actually send real email don't
do this.) In order to subscribe to a Yahoo mailing list, you need the
following whitelist entry:

    %@returns.groups.yahoo.com : dg@cowlark.com
