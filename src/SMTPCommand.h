/* Revision history
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.6  2007/10/24 20:44:15  dtrg
 * Did a lot of minor code cleanups and C++ style improvements: uncopyable C++
 * objects are now marked as such and do not have copy constructors, and RAI is
 * used for the threadlet mutex.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2007/02/10 00:24:35  dtrg
 * Added support for TLS connections using the GNUTLS library. A X509
 * certificate and private key must be supplied for most purposes, but if they
 * are not provided anonymous authentication will be used instead (which
 * apparently only GNUTLS supports). Split the relay check up into two
 * separate parts; the trustedhosts table now specifies machines that can be
 * trusted to play nice, and can do relaying and be allowed to bypass the
 * greylisting; and allowedrecipients, which specifies what email address we're
 * expecting to receive. Also fixed some remaining niggles in the AUTH
 * proxy support, but this remains largely untested.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2007/01/31 12:58:25  dtrg
 * Added basic support for upstream AUTH requests based on Juan José
 * Gutiérrez de Quevedoo (juanjo@iteisa.com's patch. AUTH requests are
 * proxied through to the downstream server. Parts of the code still need a
 * rethink but it should all work.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/11/18 17:57:20  dtrg
 * Rewrote logging system so that it no longer tries to subclass stringstream,
 * that was producing bizarre results on gcc 3.3. Added version tracking to the
 * makefile; spey now knows what version and build number it is, and displays the
 * information in the startup banner. Now properly ignores SIGPIPE, which was
 * causing intermittent silent aborts.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/06/22 21:01:02  dtrg
 * Made a lot of minor tweaks so that spey now builds under gcc 3.3. (3.3 is a lot
 * closer to the C++ standard than 2.95 is; plus, the standard library is now
 * rather different, which means that I'm not allowed to do things like have local
 * variables called errno.)
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/05/01 12:20:20  dtrg
 * Initial version.
