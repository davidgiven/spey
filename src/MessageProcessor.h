/* Revision history
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.5  2007/02/01 18:41:48  dtrg
 * Reworked the SMTP AUTH code so that spey automatically figures out what
 * authentication mechanisms there are by asking the downstream server. The
 * external-auth setting variable is now a boolean. Rearranged various
 * other bits of code and fixed a lot of problems with the man pages.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/06/30 20:18:49  dtrg
 * Changed the way sockets are initialised; instead of doing it from the Socket
 * and SocketServer constructors, they're set up as zombies and initialised later
 * with an init() method. This is cleaner, and also allows a cunning new feature:
 * the connection to the downstream SMTP server is now only made once the first
 * valid SMTP command is received from the upstream SMTP server. This means that
 * connections are only made once we're reasonably sure that there's going to be a
 * valid SMTP conversation, which should harden spey against DoS attacks like the
 * ones I get every so often. Also took the opportunity to convert more this->blah
 * instance variables into _blah.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/06/08 19:58:04  dtrg
 * Fixed a bug where the address of incoming connections was thought to be the
 * address of *this* end of the connection, not the other end. In the process,
 * changed some this->blah instance variables to _blah.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/05/30 01:55:13  dtrg
 * Numerous and major alterations to implement a system for processing more than
 * one message at a time, based around coroutines. Fairly hefty rearrangement of
 * constructors and object ownership semantics. Assorted other structural
 * modifications.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/05/01 12:20:20  dtrg
 * Initial version.
